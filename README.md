# Data Scientist

## üëã About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Sai Paritala! I‚Äôm a data scientist and applied epidemiologist with over 15 years of experience in building data-driven solutions for public health. My expertise lies at the intersection of data science and epidemiology, focusing on infectious disease surveillance, forecasting, and developing analytic tools.

üîç I enjoy working with complex datasets, building predictive models, and crafting dashboards to help organizations unlock insights and make informed decisions. Whether it‚Äôs wrangling messy data, developing ETL pipelines, or using statistical models for real-world challenges, I thrive on solving impactful problems.

üí° Some of my current interests include:
- Machine Learning and Time Series Forecasting
- Building dashboards with Tableau and Power BI
- Cloud computing and ETL automation with Azure & Databricks

When I‚Äôm not analyzing data, I enjoy mentoring other data professionals, staying active in the epidemiology community, and continuously sharpening my skills in emerging technologies.
